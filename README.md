# Image-Annotation-without-using-Object-Detection-Model
Developed a Python algorithm using image processing techniques to partially de-annotate images by removing specific annotations without re-annotating the original image. Employed OpenCV and dynamic bounding box expansion to achieve efficient and scalable results, ensuring preservation of the original image's integrity.
